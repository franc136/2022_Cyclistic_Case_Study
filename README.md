## Introduction

The following is a Case Study prepared by Sean Francis for the fictional company Cyclistic. Cyclistic is a bicycle rideshare company based in Chicago, IL, but the actual data is pulled from the real rideshare company DIVVY. The case study looks at annual rideshare data collected in 2022 to answer questions posed by the marketing team, to assist in targeting their efforts for their upcoming digital marketing campaign.

## Business Task

The questions posed by the marketing team that this case study will be exploring are the following:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy a Cyclistic annual membership?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Casual riders are defined as rideshare customers who purchase one-off single rides or full-day rides with the Cyclistic service. Member riders are defined as customers who have purchased an annual membership with Cyclistic and can use the bikes as many times as they want within the calendar year of their membership. This case study will examine similarities, trends, and differences between these two groups, and make recommendations based on the findings to the marketing team.
